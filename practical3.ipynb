    "# ConvNet Architectures\n",
    "When modelling an image using a regular feed-forward network, we quickly find that the number of model parameters grows exponentially. For example, our 2 layer MNIST feed-forward model from the previous practical already had over 600 000 parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUESTION**: How many parameters would a feed-forward network require if it had 2 hidden layers with 512 and 256 neurons respectively, an output size of 10 and an input image of shape [32, 32, 3]?\n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNets address this model parameter issue by exploiting structure in the inputs to the network (in particular, by making the assumption that the input is a 3D volume, which applies to images for example). The two key differences between a ConvNet and a Feed-forward network are:\n",
    "* ConvNets have neurons that are arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth (depth here means the depth of an activation volume, not the depth of a deep neural network!)\n",
    "* The neurons in each layer are only connected to a small region of the layer before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUESTION**: Unfortunately there is no such thing as a free lunch. What do you think is the trade-off a ConvNet makes for the reduction in memory required by fewer parameters? \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally a ConvNet architecture is made up of different types of layers, the most common being **convolutional layers**, **pooling layers** and **fully connected layers** that we encountered in the last practical. \n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNet architectures were key to the tremendous success of deep learning in machine vision. In particular, the first deep learning model to win the ImageNet competition in 2012 was called AlexNet (after Alex Krizhevsky, one of its inventors). It had 5 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers. Later winners included GoogLeNet and ResNet which also used batch normalisation, a technique we will see in this practical. If you're curious, have a look at [this](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/neural-network-architectures-156e5bad51ba) link for a great summary of different ConvNet archiectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by implementing the forward and backward passes of these layers in Numpy to get a good sense for how they work. Afterwards, we will implement a full ConvNet classifier in TensorFlow that we will apply to the MNIST dataset. This model should give us the best test accuracy we've seen so far! "

    "## Convolutional Layers\n",
    "A convolutional layer maps an **input volume**\\* to an **output volume** through a set of **learnable filters**, which make up the parameters of the layer. Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume. (Eg: A filter in the first layer of a ConvNet might have size [5, 5, 3]). During the forward pass, we convolve (\"slide\") each filter across the width and height of the input volume and compute dot products between the entries of the filter and the input at any position. As we slide the filter over the width and height of the input volume we will produce a 2-dimensional activation map that gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. Each convolutional layer will have a set of filters, and each of them will produce a separate 2-dimensional activation map. We will stack these activation maps along the depth dimension to produce the output volume. \n",

For example, a colour image is often represented as a 3 dimensional tensor of shape `[width, height, channels]` where `channels` refers to the colour values. A common colour encoding is RGB which has a value between 0 and 256 for each of the red, green and blue channels.\n",

    "* **Depth** (D) of the layer defines the number of filters in the layer. \n",
    "* **Stride** (S) defines the number of pixels by which we move the filter when \"sliding\" it along the input volume. Typically this value would be 1, but values of 2 and 3 are also sometimes used. \n",
    "* **Padding** (P) refers to the number of 0 pixels we add to the input volume along the width and height dimensions. This parameter is useful in that it gives us more control over the desired size of the output volume and in fact is often used to ensure that the output volume has the same width and height as the input volume. \n",

    "Our implementations of convolutional and max-pool layers were based on loops, which are easy to understand, but are slow and inefficient compared to a vectorised implementation exploiting matrix multiplications. The vectorised form is how these layers are actually implemented in practice and are also required to make efficient use of GPUs in frameworks that support it, like TensorFlow. As an exercise, once you fully understand how the layers work, try to rewrite the code such that the convolution and max-pool operations are each implemented in a **single matrix multiplication**. \n",

This can be interpreted as there being actually $2^n$ different network architectures (where n is the number of neurons) while only one is being trained at each training step. At test time, we use the full network, where each neuron's contribution is weighted by `keep_prob`. This is effectively the average of all the network possibilities and therefore dropout can also be thought of as an ensemble technique. \n",

    "Remember that a filter in a convolutional layer is used to multiply blocks in the input volume. Let's plot the weights of the first layer of the trained model. Darker pixels indicate that the particular filter reacts more strongly to those regions of the input blocks. Notice how each filter has learned to react differently to different patterns in the input. It's tricky to see in our tiny filters, but those in lower layers of ConvNets, particularly when applied to natural images, often function as simple Gabor filters or edge detectors, while filters in higher layers often react to more abstract shapes and concepts. \n",

    "# Aside: The Effect of Random Initialization - RUN THIS ON A GPU INSTANCE ONLY!\n",
    "Initialization of model parameters matters! Here is a ConvNet with different, but seemingly sensible, initialization of the weights in the linear layer. Running this gives significantly worse results. Judging by the accuracy plot, it's possible that training this model long enough will get it to a simliar level as before, but it will take much longer. This shows that initialization of model parameters is a an important consideration, especially as models become more complex. In practice, there are a number of different initialization schemes to consider. In particular, [Xavier](http://andyljones.tumblr.com/post/110998971763/an-explanation-of-xavier-initialization) tends to work well with ConvNets and is worth considering. We won't go into any details in this practical though."

    "## Batch Normalisation\n",
    "Batch normalisation (batch norm) is a more recent (2015) and arguably more powerful normalisation technique than dropout. It is based on the observation that machine learning models often perform better and train faster when their inputs are normalised to have 0 mean and unit variance. In multi-layered deep neural networks, the output of one layer becomes the input to the next. The insight behind batch norm is that each of these layer inputs can also be normalised. Batch norm has been shown to have numerous benefits including:\n",
    "* Networks tend to train faster\n",
    "* Allows higher learning rates to be used (further improving training speed).\n",
    "* Reduced sensitivity to weight initialisation.\n",
    "* Makes certain activation functions feasible in deep networks (When inputs have very large (absolute) expected values, certain activation functions become saturated (For example, the output of sigmoid is always to 1 for large inputs). Relu activations can also \"die out\" when the expected value of the input is a large negative value (why?). This results in wasted computation as these neurons become uninformative. Normalising the inputs to have 0 mean keeps these activation functions in the \"sensible\" parts of their domains.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work? \n",
    "To normalise some inputs X, ideally we would like to set\n",
    "$\\hat X = \\frac{X - E[X]}{\\sqrt{VAR[X]}}$\n",
    "but this requires knowledge of the population mean and variance statistics, which we don't know, at least during training. We therefore use the **sample mean** and **sample variance** of each batch encountered during training as unbiased estimates of these statistics. During testing, we use statistics gathered throughout training as better estimates of the population statistics. In addition to this, we would like the model to have some flexibility over the extent to which batch norm is applied, and this flexibility should be learned! In order to do this, we introduce two new trainable parameters, $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ for each layer that batch norm is applied to. Suppose we have a batch of inputs to a layer, $B={x_1,...,x_m}$, we normalise these as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu_B = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Batch mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\sigma_B}^2 = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - \\mu_B)^2$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Batch variance)\n",
    " \n",
    "$\\hat x_i= \\frac{x_i - \\mu_B}{\\sqrt{{\\sigma_B}^2}}$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Normalised)\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_i = \\gamma \\hat x_i + \\beta$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Scale and shift)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At test time, we normalise using the mean and variance computed over the entire training set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[x] = E_B[\\mu_B]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$VAR[x] = \\frac{m}{m-1}E_B[{\\sigma_B}^2]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat x = \\frac{x - E[x]}{\\sqrt{VAR[x]}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\gamma \\hat x + \\beta$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "Tracking the mean and variance over the training set can become a little fiddly. Many implementations also use a *moving average* of the batch mean and variance as estimates of the population mean and variance for use during testing. Luckily, TensorFlow provides batch norm out of the box in the form of the `tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the behaviour of batch norm changes during training and testing, we need to pass a placeholder input to the function that indicates which phase we are in. Furthermore, the batch norm function uses variable updates to track the moving average mean and variance. These values are not used during training and so TensorFlow's graph execution logic will not naturally run these updates when you run a training step. In order to get around this, the `batch_norm` function adds these update ops to a *graph collection* that we can access in our training function. The following code, which you will see in the `train_tf_model` function retrieves these ops and then adds a *control dependency* to the optimiser step. This effectively tells TensorFlow that the update_ops must be run before the optimizer_step can be run, ensuring that the estimates are updated whenever we do a training step. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)\n",
    "with tf.control_dependencies(update_ops):\n",
    "    optimizer_step = optimizer_fn.minimize(loss)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Further choices to consider when using batch norm are where to apply it (some apply it immediately before each activation function, some *after* the activation function), whether to apply it to all layers and whether or not to *share* the gamma and beta parameters over all layers or have separate values for each layer. . \n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the ConvNetClassifer class above to see what choices were made, try changing these and see what results you get! (See the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers/batch_norm) for a list of even more parameters you can experiment with)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, finally, let's switch batch norm on and see how our ConvNetClassifier performs. (Note: we shouldn't expect it to necessarily perform better than dropout as we are already close to the limits of how well we can classify MNIST with our relatively small ConvNet!)\n"
